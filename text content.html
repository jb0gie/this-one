		I’m a creative innovator based on earth, conceptualising delightful visual experiences for mobile / web that inturn empower &amp; engage users.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although like many, one weakness I acknowledge is not valuing myself highly and this is something I routinely work on improving. Regardless of weakness, some of my strengths include: Impeccable timing. Now I don't mean I'm super punctual, nothing like that.
	</p>
	<p>
		What I mean is no matter how much effort I put in, I'm always in place need to be. I express myself through movement and making others laugh.

		Domestication is the key to success in life. So I played along with the rules and made a few
		mistakes. I'm not a perfectionist, but I'm a perfectionist. So much so i've wanted this page to
		be a perfect it never saw the digital light of day.
	</p>
	<p>
		Maybe i had to live life first before i could write this, who knows. But i'm proud of what i've
		done &amp; where i've been. Learning is life, and learning is fun.
